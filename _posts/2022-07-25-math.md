While working on my REU project at Emory University, I was quite fascinated by how one can approximate the solution to a complicated PDE if some characteristics are known. 

In optimal control theory, a main equation of interest is the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE (HJB):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:HJB}
    -\partial_{s} \Phi(s,z) + H(s, z, p) = 0, \qquad \Phi(T,z) = g(z),
\end{equation}
where $$\Phi(s,z)$$ is the unknown value function, $$H(s, z, p)$$ is the Hamiltonian specific to the problem, and $$g$$ is some terminal cost.  

Then, one may parameterize $$\Phi$$ using a neural network and train it's weights using the objective function of the control problem and penalty terms that enforce \eqref{eq:HJB}. This approach, combined with the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, can yield a sufficiently optimal global policy for the control problem. A more detailed explanation of this approach can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03270).
