I have finally decided to make a personal website. I wanted to make one for a long time but was especially inspired by my friend Linghai Liu when he showed me [his personal website](https://lliu58b.github.io/). Special thanks to Linghai for showing me how to utilize Github Pages. I also want to thank [Mathias Heider](https://mathheider.github.io/) for building his website along with mine.

My website is pretty empty now but I hope to add many things as my career progresses! I end this announcement with a quote from my favorite detective:

> Education never ends, Watson. It is a series of lessons, with the greatest for the last.
