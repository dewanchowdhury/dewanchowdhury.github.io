Hello. My name is Dewan Chowdhury.

As of September 2022, I am a junior at Rutgers University studying mathematics. 

My primary interest is in analysis of PDEs, and am somewhat also interested in
numerical analysis. My CV is available [here]({https://www.overleaf.com/read/kbwkwzbwkddv). 

Aside from school and work, I watch anime, read mystery novels, and play tennis.
