Hello. My name is Dewan Chowdhury. As of September 2022, I am a junior at Rutgers University studying mathematics. I am set to graduate in May 2024 with a B.S. and hope to attend graduate school to obtain a Ph.D.

My primary interest is in analysis of PDEs, and am somewhat also interested in numerical analysis. I am also the acting vice-president of the [Rutgers Undergraduate Math Association (RUMA)](https://ruma.rutgers.edu/).

Aside from school and work, I watch anime, read mystery novels, and play tennis. My favorite teams are the New York Jets, Brooklyn Nets, and New York Mets.
